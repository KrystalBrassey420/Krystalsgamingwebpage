            <h4><ins>There are 7 Palico Gadets</ins></h4>
             <ol>
                 <li>Vigorwasp</li>
                 <p> 
                     The palico pulls out a vigorwasp 
                     and rides it to the hunter, once he
                     reaches you the vigorwasp explodes 
                     with a healing spray. When leveled 
                     yup the palico can place a vigorwasp 
                     station, like one found in the locales.
                 </br>
                     In Iceborne
                 </p>
                 <li>Flashfly Cage</li>
                 <p>
                     The palico places a cage with a flashfly 
                     inside it, the hunter is then able to run 
                     to it, slash it and blind the monser if 
                     timed correctly. When leveled the Palico 
                     can deploy and thunderbug trap, this shocks 
                     the monster like a shock trap, but like a 
                     shock trap if overused the monster can 
                     become resistant.
                    </br> 

                     In Iceborne you are able to unlock the
                     Boombug cage, when the palico places it 
                     you are able to lure the monster into it 
                     making it explode damaging the monster.

                   However this weapon is tricky to wield
                   its slow and cumbersome nature makes it

                   the ability to sever tails and this allows you

                  hit is low but completeing a combo and dealig a 
                  large amount of hits allows for a large damage
