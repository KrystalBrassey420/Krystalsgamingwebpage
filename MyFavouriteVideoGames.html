            Monster Hunter Wold:Iceborne is not a typical game, 
            the games objective is to hunt monsters as the name
            suggests, there are different monster types 
            and there are there different difficuly ranges. In order 
            to hunt these monsters you have what is called scount flies,
            they help track the monsters, the more tracks and other 
            monster evidance you collect the quicker you will be able
            to find the monster at the start of quests.
            Two which are the base game Monster Hunster World 
            and one which is Iceborne Together they 
            complete the game Monster Hunter World:Iceborne
    </p>
    <p>  <h2>The ranges of difficulty are:</h2> 
         <h3>Low Rank(Monster Hunter Hunter World)</h3>
             This ranges from 1 Star to 5 Stars </br>
              Within theses lets call them stages you will 
              recieve quests to hunt different types of 
              monsters,these monsters do become increaseingly 
              harder to fight as you progress through the
              quests
         <h3>High Rank(Monster Hunter Hunter World)</h3>
             This ranges from 6 stars to 9 Stars
              Here you will fight mostly the same monsters but 
              they are now hard to fight. The difficulty of the 
              monsters icrease substancially. In these stages 
              they introduce a few new monsters to the game
              aswell.

         <h3> Master Rank (Iceborne)</h3>
             Master rank is an expansion of the game which 
             comes from Iceborne. The Stages range from 1 Star
             to 6 Stars, in the expansion they introduce 
             new monsters as well as variant monsters, that are

            Each weapon has a bone tree and a ore tree
            and with these trees its stems to different 
            monsters you fight in the game. Not all of them

                  this weapon is one of the hardest 
                  hitting weapons in the game. Dealing a 
                   large amount of damage per second.
                   However this weapon is tricky to wield
                   its slow and cumbersome nature makes it 
                   hard to land your hits, mastering this weapon 
                   is hard but not impossible. This weapon has
                   the ability to sever tails and this allows you
                   to crave the tail as a reward.

                   and allows for a moderate defense. 
                   Although not to be underestimated, 
                   in the right hands this weapon is very 
                   powerful, much like the hunting horn

                  is suited for those who prefer to
                  evaded and attack quickly. However damage per
                  hit is low but completeing a combo and dealig a 
                  large amount of hits allows for a large damage 
                  per second, rivalling that of the great sword.

                  varied combos, the long sword is difficult to master
                  and more of an advanced weapon type.

                  increasing your rewards dropped.
                  This is my favourite weapon.

                  a buff attached to it. This weapon is 
                  hard to master but in capable hands 
                  can deal a great deal of damage. This weapon
                  can also provide buffs for your whole team 
                  whilst playing multiplayer, hence its 
                  suitability for support based combat.
