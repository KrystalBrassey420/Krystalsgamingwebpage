                      hitting weapons in the game. Dealing a large amount of damage per second.
                      However this weapon is tricky to wield its slow and cumbersome nature makes it 
                      hard to land your hits, mastering this weapon is hard but not impossible. This weapon has
                      the ability to sever tails and this allows you to carve the tail as a reward.

                       powerful, much like the hunting horn

                      large amount of hits allows for a large damage per second, rivalling that of the great sword.
